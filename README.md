# About project
Developed an interactive dashboard that enables individuals with varying nutritional objectives to make informed decisions and select a nutritious beverage based on the presented nutritional analysis.

# Highlights:

1. Selection of one or multiple beverage categories can be done for nutritional assessment of only those beverages which belong to selected category/categories.
2. Based on the nutritional comparison, once the drink is chosen, select that drink from option given below to know more about the nutritional components present in that drink.
3. Size customization and milk customization can be done to accurately assess the nutritional components present in the drink.
4. An additional section of recommended beverages is also given on the basis of this analysis which shows best suited beverages for people with different nutritional goals.
